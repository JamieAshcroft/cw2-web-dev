Coursework 2 for web development module as part of my computer science degree at University.

====TASK====
Images were provided for the UI design and layout, which using the skills taught throughout the module,
I had to recreate using HTML, CSS and JS.

Secondly, the main task was pulling data from a file and displaying it on a webpage. This was done for
the reviews page in which all the reviews where ordered and displayed using JS.

For this piece of coursework I achieved a mark of 82 which is a first.
